Amazingly our graphic designer Francis managed to find an old picture online showing the front of the shop.

Here, sun-drenched vineyards on well-draining limestone and clay soils are situated between the Garonne and Dordogne Rivers.  Warm days and cool evenings provide optimal growing conditions for the slow ripening of grapes and excellent flavour development.<p>\r\nMerlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec -- three of the classic grape varieties of Bordeaux – were blended together in crafting this wine.  Fruit was sourced from premium vineyards in the eastern part of Entre-Deux-Mers, a terroir particularly well-suited to these varietals.  The wine was made using traditional vinification practices:  Each varietal was vinified separately including temperature-controlled macerations of 4-5 weeks for maximum extraction of flavour and colour.  The wines were then aged an additional nine months prior to final blending.<p>\r\nDeep purple in colour, this wine reveals gorgeous scents of wild berries including blackberries, raspberries and black currants in the glass. Additional spicy notes and hints of violet are contributed by the Malbec.  On the round, well-balanced palate, more ripe fruit flavours merge seamlessly with velvety tannins from the Merlot. Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives added freshness, backbone and age-worthiness to this authentic Bordeaux bottling.<p>\r\nAn excellent food wine, enjoy this Bordeaux Claret with chesses, game, grilled red meats, hearty stews and more.<p>\r\nBlend: 70% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Malbec\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Downton Abbey Blanc</b><br>\r\nThis classic Bordeaux white wine is an elegant, dry version made with grapes sourced from the famed Entre-Deux-Mers (\"between two seas\") region of Bordeaux, France. Here, sun-drenched vineyards on well-draining limestone and clay soils are situated between the Garonne and Dordogne Rivers, creating ideal grape growing conditions featuring warm days tempered by the cool evenings.<p>\r\nA blend of Muscadelle and Semillion fruit from the northern part of the region was used in crafting this wine. Grapes were harvested at the perfect moment of ripeness for maximum aromas and flavours.  Ferments took place in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks to harness even more bright fruit characters and freshness.  Following fermentation, the juice underwent maturation on fine lees to add richness and complexity to the final blend.<p>\r\nIn the glass, this wine is a lovely pale yellow in colour.  On the expressive nose, classic notes of tangerine lead to more citrusy notes and delicious flavours of apricots on a harmonious, crisp palate.  The wine is perfectly balanced offering roundness on the palate, complimented by a refreshing, lingering finish.<p>\r\nEnjoy this wine as delicious accompaniment to goat cheese, fish, shellfish and more, or as a refreshing aperitif all on its own.<p>\r\nBlend: 70% Muscadelle, 30% Semillon Blanc.<p>"},{"name":"Tania et Vincent Careme Terre Brulee Chenin Blanc 2015","description":""},{"name":"Francis Ford Coppola Sofia Mini Blanc de Blancs 4-Pack","description":""},{"name":"Chateau de France Rouge 2014","description":""},{"name":"Chateau Ste.

His house is still standing in New Harmony.  The Harmonist brewer and cooper, George Bentel, was born November 3, 1781 in Iptingen, the same village in the Swabian kingdom of Württemberg where George Rapp was born.  Bentel lived at the northeast corner of Brewery and Grainery streets, where his house remains today, as upright as when Indiana's first brewer marched out to make his beer almost two centuries ago.\r\nThe German utopian communalists in New Harmony were Indiana's first significant brewers. Beginning in 1816, the Harmonists eventually brewed enough to sell all the way up to what is now West Virginia and down into lower Illinois. From the historical record, it appears the Harmonists brewed a porter-like dark beer. It must have been pretty good beer: An educated German, Ferdinand Ernst, stopped in New Harmony during his journey through the frontier region. “They served me a stein of beer,” Ernst wrote, “and I was not a little astonished to find here a genuine, real Bamberg beer.” He gushed that the Harmonists “must be happiest people of entire Christiandom.” A Louisville agent for the Harmonists reported, “Mr. Breeden, the most celebrated porter seller in the place says the strongest part of it would almost pass for porter and is the best beer he has ever seen in this country…","abv":"5.7"},{"name":"Roots Run Deep Educated Guess Cabernet Sauvignon 2015","description":""},{"name":"Simi Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2014","description":""},{"name":"Dry Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2013","description":""},{"name":"Frei Brothers Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2014","description":""},{"name":"Gloria Ferrer Sonoma Brut","description":""},{"name":"Delas Cotes du Rhone St. Esprit Rouge 2014","description":""},{"name":"Piece of Cake - Dessert Stout","description":"This elegantly delicious sweet stout was created to be the perfect dessert beer.

A small mountain of French sea salt aids in turning the volume up on the intricate Petit Verdot grape profile and bridging it to the beer's tart and sour base.

Papa Noel's has a pleasing sweetness from its higher-than-normal alcoholic content, and from its complex malt foundation.This sweetness is balanced by a hint of roasted flavor, as well as a mellow bitterness imparted by a generous amount of English Fuggle hops. Other flavors in evidence are bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and toffee. Papa Noel's Olde Ale is the perfect brew to warm the body and nourish the soul during the cold and wet holiday season.

Something with substance, where the craft of coffee brewing and the craft of beer brewing were perfectly matched into one delicious drink. After some research, we sought out and established a partnership with The Brown Coffee Company, in San Antonio, Texas.\r\n\r\nWe quickly learned from Founder and “Coffee Hunter” Aaron Blanco that Brown is not just special, it is unique in its market. You see, Aaron sources his coffee beans for his craft roasting by establishing direct relationships with coffee farmers around the world. He travels to farms and stays with farmers, and regularly hosts them in San Antonio. He seeks out the best of the best coffees, understanding the unique environment and character of each coffee variety where it is grown, as well as which processing methods best suit which coffees, all in pursuit of the perfect cup.\r\n\r\nWhile Brown works diligently to be as transparent and “invisible” as possible in selecting, roasting and serving their coffees, when it comes to our El Despierto Coffee Porter, it is anything but invisible. The coffee in El Despierto comes from the Madan Estate in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is a huge coffee with a deep, spicy, tobacco leaf sweetness that converges perfectly with our beer to create something special. Unique.

Although we’ve only started making the Louie’s Resurrection recently, barrel aging beer is nothing new.\r\n\r\nWooden barrels have been around for a few thousand years, the Bonze Age Celts, Vikings and similar tribes have been attributed with the invention of barrels. Wooden barrels have been perfect for holding liquids, withstanding large amounts of pressure and travel. Belgians seem to be the first to take advantage of the wood flavors aging their beers to create sours.\r\n\r\nMalty beers are typically great candidates for barrel aging beers, as their natural characteristics blend nicely with the strong oak flavors barrels give to the beer. The wood contains chemicals that dissolve into the beer. One of these chemicals is lignin, which transforms into vanillin and thats why a lot of barrel aged beers pick up a vanilla flavor. These extra flavor dimensions that the barrels give to the beer have sparked a fad across American craft breweries.

At the Palace of Versailles Louis XIV was the first French King to drink Champagne.<p>Louis XIV's era became known as the Grand Siècle - the \"Great Century\". Bottled in a replica of a 17th Century bottle evoking the radiance of that period, Laurent-Perrier's prestige cuvées embody luxury, magnificence and elegance fit for a king.<p>When it came to his prestige cuvée, Bernard de Nonancourt decided to highlight two of Champagne's traditional realms of proficiency: the blending of different crus and different vintages. Grand Siècle is the epitome of Champagne cuvées, as it blends complementary wines from Laurent-Perrier's very best growths and most successful vintage years.<p>Grand Siècle is made with a pinot noir and chardonnay blend, with the latter being slightly dominant. Twelve of the most prestigious villages supply these grapes; all of them classified at 100% Grands Crus such as Ambonnay, Verzenay, Mailly, Avize, Cramant, Chouilly and Le Mesnil-sur-Oger. Within the vineyards of these villages, only the very best plots are selected, as are the finest musts from the pressings. The blended wine is then aged during the second fermentation on the yeast for approximately five years.<p>It has a bright color, with a brilliant yellow hue.
