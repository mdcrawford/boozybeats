       description: 'Milwaukee Brewing Co’s take on a classic European style. Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The “Admiral” Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.\r\n\r\nWe first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as “Shake Down Nut Brown”. You can guess what went wrong from there… But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.\r\n\r\nWe use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.',

At a hefty 9% ABV, the alcohol in this brew is balanced by a light sweetness, a full-bodied mouth feel and a gentle, lingering hop character. \r\n\r\nJust prior to bottling, when there is no carbonation present in the beer, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast is added. After bottling, the beer is aged in our temperature-controlled cellar, where the yeast ferments the sugar and naturally carbonates the beer. This process, known as méthode champenoise, is the same traditional process we use for all of our bottled beers. \r\n\r\nThe batch of 11th Anniversary Ale was bottled in May of \'06 - 950 cases, six bottles in each case and is the only batch that will be available.

       description: 'In the 15 years since we entered the craft brewing world, change has come not in a straight line, but as an exponential curve. The craft brewing movement has long been called a "revolution." But today the air is so thick with revolution, it\'s palpable. No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that there\'s something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down lowest-common-denominator mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we\'re talking only about the world of brewing, but we\'re not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be "food" that our great-grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can\'t dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted "norms" over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, and mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children\'s children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don\'t think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it\'s up to you to decide. We hope you\'ll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight. Cheers to all we\'ve accomplished together in the past 15 years, and cheers to the adventure ahead!',

(But a barleywine is all beer!)\r\nThe process of creating our barleywine began by cramming our mash tun to overflowing with American and Scottish pale malts.

During the boil a touch of honey was added to the kettle, along with six varieties of hops to provide balance for the sweet malt. Fermented in stainless it was then sent to the CBC Barrel Cellar where it aged in a quintet of Buffalo Trace rye barrels (previously used for aging a strong beer named Utopias, brewed by our neighbors in J.P.).\r\nThe result is well worth this painstaking ordeal. A creamy, pale tan head rests atop this beautiful, hazy golden liquid.

As it warms, more distinguishable notes of burnt sugar and toffee, vanilla, coconut and oak are detectable. The flavor more than meets the prelude of aromas. Its rich, full body contains notes of sweet caramel, tart flavors of berries and dried fruit, and a subtle herbal hoppiness.
