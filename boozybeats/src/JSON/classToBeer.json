Utilizing a grape that most often makes up smaller percentages of wine blends in France, we extract massive leathery notes, hints of tobacco, heavy beats of beets, delicate tannins, jammy notes of raspberries and boysenberries, and then finally a very effervescent cranberry-like finish. A small mountain of French sea salt aids in turning the volume up on the intricate Petit Verdot grape profile and bridging it to the beer's tart and sour base. Petit Verdot Grand Gose is a rare breed; bright and refreshing on its finish making it easy to throw back pints repeatedly, but also a wealth of complexity that can be slowly sipped and analyzed as if you were studying for your Sommelier exam.",

Bentel lived at the northeast corner of Brewery and Grainery streets, where his house remains today, as upright as when Indiana's first brewer marched out to make his beer almost two centuries ago.\r\nThe German utopian communalists in New Harmony were Indiana's first significant brewers. Beginning in 1816, the Harmonists eventually brewed enough to sell all the way up to what is now West Virginia and down into lower Illinois. From the historical record, it appears the Harmonists brewed a porter-like dark beer. It must have been pretty good beer: An educated German, Ferdinand Ernst, stopped in New Harmony during his journey through the frontier region. “They served me a stein of beer,” Ernst wrote, “and I was not a little astonished to find here a genuine, real Bamberg beer.” He gushed that the Harmonists “must be happiest people of entire Christiandom.” A Louisville agent for the Harmonists reported, “Mr. Breeden, the most celebrated porter seller in the place says the strongest part of it would almost pass for porter and is the best beer he has ever seen in this country…",

After some research, we sought out and established a partnership with The Brown Coffee Company, in San Antonio, Texas.\r\n\r\nWe quickly learned from Founder and “Coffee Hunter” Aaron Blanco that Brown is not just special, it is unique in its market. You see, Aaron sources his coffee beans for his craft roasting by establishing direct relationships with coffee farmers around the world. He travels to farms and stays with farmers, and regularly hosts them in San Antonio. He seeks out the best of the best coffees, understanding the unique environment and character of each coffee variety where it is grown, as well as which processing methods best suit which coffees, all in pursuit of the perfect cup.\r\n\r\nWhile Brown works diligently to be as transparent and “invisible” as possible in selecting, roasting and serving their coffees, when it comes to our El Despierto Coffee Porter, it is anything but invisible. The coffee in El Despierto comes from the Madan Estate in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. It is a huge coffee with a deep, spicy, tobacco leaf sweetness that converges perfectly with our beer to create something special. Unique.

Although we’ve only started making the Louie’s Resurrection recently, barrel aging beer is nothing new.\r\n\r\nWooden barrels have been around for a few thousand years, the Bonze Age Celts, Vikings and similar tribes have been attributed with the invention of barrels. Wooden barrels have been perfect for holding liquids, withstanding large amounts of pressure and travel. Belgians seem to be the first to take advantage of the wood flavors aging their beers to create sours.\r\n\r\nMalty beers are typically great candidates for barrel aging beers, as their natural characteristics blend nicely with the strong oak flavors barrels give to the beer. The wood contains chemicals that dissolve into the beer. One of these chemicals is lignin, which transforms into vanillin and thats why a lot of barrel aged beers pick up a vanilla flavor. These extra flavor dimensions that the barrels give to the beer have sparked a fad across American craft breweries. A really delicious fad.",

It’s a dessert in itself!\r\n\r\nNote – we brew Fat Alberta once a year, sometimes twice. When we release the beer, we sell out here at the brewery in a day. This makes folks wonder ‘why don’t you brew it more often then??’. We don’t because it is a very expensive beer for us to make – taking up one of our fermenters for months. Given the high alcohol percentage, we also get half the yield of our typical batches. As a result, Fat Alberta is a special treat that we (and our customers) look forward to every year – just a few weeks before Christmas!",
